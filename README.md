Thin wrapper which makes ORB_SLAM3 a valid Colcon package.

Contains _no_ ORB_SLAM3 code, ORB_SLAM3 is included as a gitmodule.  Note also this contains _no_ ROS2 code / nodes (not even the ROS samples included with ORB-SLAM3), those are assumed to be provided by another package.

Inspired in part by [thien94/orb_slam3_ros](https://github.com/thien94/orb_slam3_ros), a similar wrapper for ROS1.
